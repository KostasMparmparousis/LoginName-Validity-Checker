                <i>uAssign</i> is an all-around mechanism designed to assist the University Account creation procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the procedure of creating a new University Account, a loginName for the new account must be decided.
                Many university services use this loginName as a personal identifier
                and therefore it must be unique per person across multiple registries.
            </p>
            <p>
                These registries are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Student Information System (SIS), for  student records.</li>
                    <li>The Human Resource Management Software (HRMS) of the University, for facutly, staff etc.</li>
                    <li>The Human Resource Management Software of the Research Committee - Special Account for Research Funds Software (ELKE) for contractual staff, associates, researchers etc.</li>
                    <li>The Directory Service (DS).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>uAssign</i> assists the user in picking a suitable loginName during the account creation process by offering the following services/endpoints:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>loginNameValidator/</b> -checks if the provided loginName can be assigned to the specified person.</li>
                    <li> <b>loginNameProposer/</b> -recommends a valid loginName for the specified person.</li>
                    <li> <b>roleFinder/</b> -provides information regarding the specified person's roles in the University (Student, Member of the Teaching Staff, Associate etc), if they already have such a role.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The endpoints respond with a <b>JSON</b> formatted answer. 
            </p>

            <h3>loginNameValidator</h3>
            <p>
                During the procedure of creating a new University Account, one must examine whether a proposed loginName for that Account would generate any conflicts with the already present data across all 4 databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <i>conflict</i> occurs when the requested <i>loginName</i> is already attributed to a different university entity than the one requesting that specific <i>loginName</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The endpoint <a href="validator.html">loginNameValidator</a> s a mechanism that will locate any conflicts or inconsistencies if this loginName were to be used.

            </p>

            <h3>loginNameProposer</h3>
            <p>
                Selecting a loginName for a new University Account is often not a straightforward procedure. Some universities use standardized patterns for creating new loginNames, a strategy that pretty much ensures their uniqueness, while others expect from the applicants to come up with their own unique loginName.
            </p>
            <p>
                This endpoint addresses the latter scenario, suggesting possible loginNames for a new Account, by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Locating previous loginNames based on given SSN & SSNCountry.</li>
                    <li>Generating new loginNames based on given firstName & lastName in the request.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The endpoint <a href="proposer.html">LoginNameProposer</a> shall propose loginNames that can be safely attributed to a new Account.
            </p>
            <h3>roleFinder</h3>
            <p>
                A difficult task for a university with thousands of active members can be to determine a person's Role in their institution. Search for a person's active Roles in a institution based on a given userName.
            </p>
            <p>
                The endpoint <a href="roleFinder.html">roleFinder</a> conducts a search based on a given loginName and decides whether a person is a Student, a Member of the Teaching Staff, an Associate, or a combination of the above.
